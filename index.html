  <h2 >Coastal Lighthouse: History and Significance</h2>
  <h3>Timeline of Lighthouse Development:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>70 BC</strong> - The first known lighthouse is built in Alexandria, Egypt. It became one of the Seven Wonders of the World.</li>
  <li><strong>16th century</strong> - The emergence of the first lighthouses using reflectors and lenses to enhance light. These lighthouses were actively used for navigation and safety of sailors.</li>
  <li><strong>1759 </strong>- John Smeaton develops the first lighthouse using a parabolic reflector in England.</li>
  <li><strong>1820s</strong> - Engineer Augustin-Jean Fresnel invents Fresnel lenses, which significantly improved the range and efficiency of lighthouse light.</li>
  <li><strong>1848</strong> - The lighthouse at Richardson Rock in California, USA, is built. It became one of the most famous navigational points on the west coast of America.</li>
  <li><strong>1862</strong> - The Hurd's Gap Lighthouse in Scotland begins using LED lamps, which was a revolution in lighthouse lighting.</li>
  <li><strong>1900</strong> - The introduction of electric incandescent lamps improves the brightness and reliability of lighthouses worldwide.</li>
  <li><strong>1960s</strong> - Automation of many lighthouses reduces the need for constant presence of lighthouse keepers.</li>
  <li><strong>2000s</strong> - Modern lighthouses are equipped with solar panels and energy-efficient LEDs, making them more environmentally friendly and autonomous.</li>
  <li><strong>2024</strong> - The Cape Greco Lighthouse (known as the "Shining Guardian") celebrates its 250th anniversary. This lighthouse symbolizes continuous development and adaptation of lighthouse technology.</li>
</ul>
  <h3>The Significance of Lighthouses</h3>
  <p>For centuries, coastal lighthouses have served as important navigational landmarks for sailors and captains. They provided safety when navigating through difficult and dangerous waters, helping to avoid rocks and reefs, thereby saving countless lives. Technological innovations, such as Fresnel lenses and LED lighting, continued to improve the effectiveness of lighthouses, making them an integral part of marine navigation.</p>
